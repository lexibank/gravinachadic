## Notes

This repository contains a selection of the data underlying the thesis of Gravina (2014). The data was extracted from a FLEX version of the database, provided by Roger Blench. In order to extract only the comparable parts of the data, we restricted the export to those lexical entries which are clearly specified by a gloss in French or English and which were reflected in at least 10 of the 50 languages which were selected in the end. The original dataset is much richer than the small standardized part presented here.
